* Plot activations in Fourier domain
* Levenshtein edit distance for checking if model is memorizing training corpus
    * Find nearest points in training set to model outputs
    * Compare lengths of matches: "coherence length" -- what length does overfitting fall apart
	* At what level is the model overfitting?
* Reverse BTAS, is one part harder to predict than others?
    * Bass-line is usually the first one filled in by hand
* Bach chorales are not solved until we address overfitting
    * Solved? Should produce things pleasant to listen to.
